# E-commerce website with dashboard

In this project I made an e-commerce website with React.js and Typescript to sell computer
accessories like keyboards, mice and etc..., also I made dashboard and fetch data with React Query for admins
and give them ability to remove or update products, I used also React Hook Form for controlling big forms in
this application, I also made some cool animations with Framer Motion to make app more beauty.

For backend I made API with nextjs 14 and use api routes for handle HTTP requests, I use mongodb as a database, and store products images in cloudinary.
