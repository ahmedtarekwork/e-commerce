# E-commerce website with dashboard

This is a small e-commerce site with dashboard, I use React.js as main JS library for this project with Typescript for type safe in my code, if you are signed in your account info will be saved with Redux, if your signed as an admin you can access the dashboard that contain nice statistics and graphs for show data with nice way by charts.js library , but you can't access it if don't login as admin, main e-commerce features are styled with SCSS and integrated with API by Tanstack React Query like authentication, cart features, add new product or edit it with comfortable form managed by React Hook Form, you can also delete data from the app if you are signed in as admin, and so more features with beautyful animations made by framer motion.

For backend I made API with nextjs 14 and use api routes for handle HTTP requests, I use mongodb as a database, and store products images in cloudinary.
